```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r}
# Read in data:
damages <- read.csv(here("damages.csv"))
warming <- read.csv(here("warming.csv"))

# Remove scientific notation
# options(scipen = 999)
```

## Question 1

```{r}
### Estimate quadratic damage function

# Visualize points:
ggplot(data = damages, aes(x = warming, y = damages)) +
  geom_point()

# Create a new data frame for warming^2:
damages$warming2 <- damages$warming^2 

# Fit quadratic regression model:
quadratic.model <-lm(damages ~ warming + warming2, data = damages)

# View model summary:
summary(quadratic.model)
```

**Estimated damages quadratic model:**
$$y = (1.9e+13)x^2 - (3e+12)x$$

```{r}
### Plot estimated damage
x = damages$warming
a = 1.959e+13
b = -3.019e+12
y = a * x^2 + b * x

damages_function <- plot(x,y, type = "l")

ggplot(data = damages, aes(x = warming, y = damages)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = damages_function)
```

## Question 2

1) Plot damages over time without pulse

```{r}

```

2) Plot damages over time with the pulse

```{r}

```

3) Difference in damages over time that arise from pulse

```{r}

```

4) Difference in damages over time from the pulse per ton of CO2

```{r}

```

## Question 3

```{r}

```

## Question 4

```{r}

```


## Question 5

```{r}

```
